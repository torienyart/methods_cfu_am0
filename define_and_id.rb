# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")

#This method will return a true/false answer to let us know if "Hello" is included
#in the preceeding data. TRUE


"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

#This method will return a true/false answer to let us know if the preceeding statement
#ends in "Hello". FALSE


"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

#This method will return a true/false answer to let us know if the preceeding statement
#ends in "rld". TRUE

12.even?

#This method will ask if the integer 12 is an even number.  TRUE

18.next

#This method will return a the next integer after the preceeding value. 19
