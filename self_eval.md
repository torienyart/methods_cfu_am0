# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

Pretty confident!  I think its mostly just a matter of memorizing what methods do what function.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Not that confident!  It feels like there are a lot of nuances in terms of quotation marks, parenthesis, and such that confuse me/result in a lot of trial and error.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

I could use some help identifying where quotation marks should/should not go!
